Maintaining the security of our code is as crucial as ensuring its functionality. One of the key aspects of security is managing and safeguarding our secrets, such as API keys, keyfiles, passwords, and tokens. Accidentally committing these secrets to your repository can lead to severe security breaches

Why secret scanning is important:

1. Prevent Data Leaks: Secrets embedded in the code can be easily exposed if not managed properly, leading to unauthorized access.
2. Compliance: Many organizations have compliance requirements that mandate the protection of sensitive data.
3. Early Detection: Scanning for secrets early in the CI pipeline helps catch issues before they make it to production.
4. Faster Time to Market through Accelerated Releases: Automated secret scanning ensures that security checks do not become bottlenecks in the release process, allowing for faster and more frequent releases.

Gitleaks is an open-source tool - inspects Git repositories for potential leaks of sensitive information. This includes passwords, API keys, and other confidential data. GitLeaks scans the code repository for files that match a set of predefined patterns. These patterns are designed to match various types of sensitive information, such as passwords, secrets, key files, etc. Once GitLeaks finds a match, it alerts, and we can take action to remove the sensitive information.
