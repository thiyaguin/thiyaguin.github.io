Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 



Kubernetes Master Node: The Kubernetes master is responsible for maintaining the desired state for Kubernetes cluster. 

Kubernetes Worker Node: The nodes in a cluster are the machines (VMs, physical servers, etc) that run the applications and cloud workflows. 
The Kubernetes master controls each worker node.
